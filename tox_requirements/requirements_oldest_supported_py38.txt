# requirement.txt for scan testing. Specifies the oldest package versions we support.

# numpy == 1.14.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.6, works for higher python version too it seems though
# numpy == 1.14.6 # min version that works with scipy 1.4.0
# numpy == 1.16.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.7. Offically the min. version for pandas==1.2.0
# numpy == 1.17.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.8. Min. version that works with pandas==1.2.0 on py39
# numpy == 1.19.3 # officially the min. version for python 3.9
numpy == 1.19.4 # 1.19 needed for networkx>=2.6

networkx == 2.6.1 # networkx 2.0.0 doesn't work with conda in py37/38, for some reason
# networkx<2.5 throws an error on py39 due to fractions.gcd having moved to math.gcd in py39
# Also, networkx 2.6.1 is needed for consistency of scale-free and small world network generation.

pandas == 1.2.0 # pandas<1.2 (<=0.25, 1.0, 1.1) doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. Isn't even installable, really

scipy == 1.5.0 # scipy<=1.3 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. also 1.4.0 added scipy.fft. 1.5 needed for networkx>=2.6
scikit-learn == 0.23.0 # scikit-learn<=0.22 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9

loguru == 0.4.1 # loguru 0.4.0 should world also, but is not in conda-forge

mpi4py == 3.0.3 # mpi4py 3.0 adds mpi4py.futures, 3.0.3 needed for pyenv py36/37 compatability, for some reason
