# requirement.txt for scan testing. Specifies the oldest package versions we support.

# numpy == 1.14.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.6, though works for higher python version too it seems
numpy == 1.14.6 # min version that works with scipy 1.4.0
# numpy == 1.16.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.7
# numpy == 1.17.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.8
# numpy == 1.19.3 # officially the min. version for python 3.9

networkx == 2.6.1 # networkx<2.5 throws an error on py39 due to fractions.gcd having moved to math.gcd in py39
# Also, networkx 2.6.1 is needed for consistency of scale-free and small world network generation!
pandas == 1.0.0 # In principle we may be able to user older pandas versions, but didn't test that yet

scipy == 1.4.0 # scipy<=1.3 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. also 1.4.0 added scipy.fft
scikit-learn == 0.20.0

loguru == 0.4.1 # loguru 0.4.0 should world also, but is not in conda-forge

mpi4py == 3.0.3 # mpi4py 3.0 adds mpi4py.futures, 3.0.3 needed for pyenv py36/37 compatability, for some reason
